    "bird_description": "This bird is native to Asian regions and was introduced to Europe and the USA, where it's also South Dakota's state bird. The Jagdfasan is commonly hunted, which also explains its German name (hunting pheasant). I've first seen this bird in our backyard on vacation, where a female and a male pheasant would somewhat regularly show up.",
