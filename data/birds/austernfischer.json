    "bird_description": "One of my favorite birds. The Austernfischer can frequently be seen at the North Sea coast. With its prominent red/orange bill this bird can open mussels to secure food. I first knowingly encountered these birds on one of the North Frisian Islands where you can hear the (easily distinguishable) calls far across the island. Ever since then, these calls remind me of the North Sea just as much as the smell of the sea itself. Surprisingly, the oystercatcher from the picture was nesting on the beach just about 15 meters away from a hiking trail.",
